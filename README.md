# Predicting-customer-churn-in-telecommunications.

## Introduction :
Customer churn, or the loss of subscribers, is a critical concern for telecommunication companies striving to maintain a competitive edge in the dynamic market. As technology evolves and customer expectations continue to rise, accurately predicting and mitigating churn has become imperative for sustaining business growth and profitability.​

Churn prediction involves the use of advanced analytics and machine learning techniques to identify potential churners before they discontinue their services. By understanding the factors that contribute to churn, telecom companies can proactively implement retention strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance overall business performance.​
